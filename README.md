This file defines a function called `passwordGen` which generates a random password based on the provided parameters.
There are 5 parameters available:
- `length`: Specifies the length of the password to be generated.
The remaining parameters
- `uppercase`
- `lowercase`
- `numbers`
- `symbols`
 specify whether or not each corresponding character set should be included in the final password.

The code first initiates an empty string named `characters` to hold the characters that will be used in the password. Then, based on the parameters passed in, the corresponding character sets are added to the `charcters` string using Python's `string` module.

Finally, using the `secrets` module of Python, the `password` variable is generated by selecting random characters from the `characters` string for `length` number of times. It then returns the randomly generated password.
