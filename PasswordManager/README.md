## Password Generator

This file defines a function called `passwordGen` which generates a random password based on the provided parameters.
There are 5 parameters available:
- `length`: Specifies the length of the password to be generated.
The remaining parameters
- `uppercase`
- `lowercase`
- `numbers`
- `symbols`
 specify whether or not each corresponding character set should be included in the final password.

The code first initiates an empty string named `characters` to hold the characters that will be used in the password. Then, based on the parameters passed in, the corresponding character sets are added to the `charcters` string using Python's `string` module.

Finally, using the `secrets` module of Python, the `password` variable is generated by selecting random characters from the `characters` string for `length` number of times. It then returns the randomly generated password.


## Password Generator GUI

This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a password generator. The GUI has input fields for the password length and checkboxes for selecting different types of characters. Users can select the character types they want to include in their password and generate a password by clicking on the "Generate Password" button. The password is then displayed in a label, and users can copy it to the clipboard by clicking on the "Copy" button. 

The code uses Python's `string`, `secrets`, `pyperclip` and `tkinter` modules to generate the password, copy it to clipboard and generate the GUI.

The GUI is defined as a class called `PasswordGeneratorGUI` that inherits from the `tk.frame` class. In the constructor, the title of the GUI window is set and the layout grid is defined using the `grid()` method.

The `createWidgets()` method creates the UI elements, including a label and entry for setting the password length, checkbuttons for selecting character types, a button for generating the password, a label for displaying the generated password, and a button for copying the generated password to the clipboard.

The `generatePassword()` method is called when the "Generate Password" button is clicked. It gets the selected password length and character types from the UI elements, generates a random password using the `secrets` library, and displays the password in the UI.

The `copyPassword()` method is called when the "Copy" button is clicked. It retrieves the generated password from the UI and uses the `pyperclip` library to copy the password to the clipboard.

The main section of the code creates the tkinter root window and sets its size and position on the screen. An instance of the PasswordGeneratorGUI class is created and the `mainloop()` method is called to start the GUI event loop.
